### My Interests
I have a strong passion for the intersection of **biology and artificial intelligence**, My current focus is on **LLMs** and **LLM agents**. My goal is to create models that enhance core capabilities like **memory, planning, reasoning, and tool use** at work

### Skills and Goals
**Skills:**  Python & C; HTML & CSS<br>
I'm trying to learn **hardware, software, and operations** as well as some basic **physics, math, and biology**. My aim is to move seamlessly across these fields, conducting research and building practical applications.

### Beyond Work
In my downtime, you might find me playing(trying to play!) **chess**, **reading books**, or catching a good **cricket** match.
